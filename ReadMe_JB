19th March, 2014 - eclipse/transit switch implementation

Took Patricio's commit from March 19th, 2014 and implemented
eclipse/transit choice path. Currently committing just changes
compared to his commit so he can pull them (take next commit for the
full code). Added eclipse.c with all functions needed for eclipse
calculation:totaltau_eclipse, tau_eclipse, eclipse_intens,
emergent_intens, printecl, eclipsepath. In transit.c path solution
variable and if statement for eclipse/transit choice are added. In
argum.c new parameter is set, new solutions is defined and read. In
Rules.mk eclipse source file is added for compiling. In proto_argum.h
new function defined in argum.c is declared. Proto_eclipse.h is made
with function defined in eclipse.c. In structure_tr.h eclipse ray
solution is made, new parameter is added to transithint structure and
transit structures, new type ray solution enum variable is defined. In
transit.h eclipse ray solution and proto_eclipse.h are included. In
Makefile new PUFLAG is added so the code can compile with 'make
transit'.

Eclipse-FluxImplementation

In eclipse.c in the function totaltau_eclipse added 'angle' as a new
parameter and the difference between two radii is calculated depending
on cos(angle). A new function intens_grid is made to allocate 2D array
for intensity grid. The structure is properly initiated and freed
after each run. In the function tau_eclipse angle is added when
totaltau_eclipse is called. In the function emergent_intens the
intensity grid array is filled. A new function 'flux' is made that
calculates surface flux (distance to the observer is incorporated in
the output converter). A new function printintens is made that prints
intensities for each angle to an output. A new function printflux is
made that prints flux values for each wavelength into a new
output. Two new functions for freeing memory for local arrays made in
eclipse.c and intensity grid structure are made and one is called in
eclipse.c and the other is called in transit.c.  In argum.c a new
parameter is added, as well the description of the parameter with its
default values. The case is made that calls a new function that parse
the characters of the new parameter from a configuration file.  In
observable.c lines that free memory are moved to transit.c.  In
transit.c in the main function a loop for calculating tau, emergent
intensity and flux for all user requested (conf file) angles are
made. Lines that free memory are moved here.  In proto_eclipse.h new
functions made in eclipse.c are added.  In proto_argum.c the new
function made in argum.c is added.  In configuration file new
parameter ray-grid that defines intensity grid is added .  In
structure_tr.h declared angles and number of angles in transithint
structure; angle index, Flux and intensity grid structure are declared
in transit structure and a new structure grid is made.  In flags_tr.h
a new flag that defines progress indicator for intensity grid
calculation is added.
